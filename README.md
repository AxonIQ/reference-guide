# Introduction

Welcome to the Axon Manual!

Axon provides the Axon Framework and the Axon Server to help build applications centered on three core concepts - CQRS \(Command Query Responsibility Segregation\) / Event Sourcing and DDD \(Domain Driven Design\).

While many types of applications can be built using Axon, it has proven to be very popular for microservices architectures. 
Axon provides an innovative and powerful way of sensibly evolving to event-driven microservices within a microservices architecture.
