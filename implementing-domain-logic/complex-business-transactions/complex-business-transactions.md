# Complex Business Transactions

In one of the [previous sections](../../introduction/architecture-overview/architecture-overview.md) we introduced the term

In the next sections we focus on Saga implementation details, testing, error handling, and 
 deadline handling. Additionally, we explain how to make a good decision on when to use a Saga in the first place.
